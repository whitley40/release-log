# Style Starter
## Get started with any new build

### Get Started
* Clone the repo
* 'npm install' for packages
* 'gulp' will run the project
* 'gulp clean' will delete the 'dist'
* browser-sync will serve the 'dist' folder on a localhost
* Changes to any 'src' folder will be pushed straight to 'dist' and served instantly
